# Hidden Bits: A Survey of Techniques for Digital Watermarking
# EER-290, Chris Shoemaker, Union College - Schenectady, NY

As part of an independent study carried out throughout the winter and spring of 2002, I investigated several techniques for the watermarking of digital images. The study consisted of three stages:

- Research current techniques for digital watermarkin
- Impliment several of these techniques in MATLAB
- Compare and discuss results of Implimentation

Presented here is the paper that I submitted, as well as the MATLAB code used for implimentation. Perhaps someone out there may find it useful :-)
